Bonfire-Auth-Driver
===================

Driver implementation for User Authentication/Authorization based on Bonfire 0.6 Auth library.

This is a users module for Bonfire, based on the 0.6 codebase, containing a modified Auth library. The Auth library implements a driver system which should allow developers to implement authentication and authorization drivers that can plug into Bonfire's Users/Roles/Permissions.
